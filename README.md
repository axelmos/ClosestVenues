# ClosestVenues
An iOS application that loads the closest 5 Foursquare venues near the current location. 
The goal of the task is to demonstrate your ability to implement CoreData, custom UI components, and Web Services integration.

Details and limitations:

■ The application must not use any third-party iOS libraries and frameworks.

■ There should be two screens switched with UISegmentControl:
● List with the closest 5 venues
● "About us" screen with sample text

■ The data has to be persisted using CoreData. When the application is loaded in offline mode, it
should display the venues that were loaded last time.

■ The application has to support the iPhone only in portrait mode.
